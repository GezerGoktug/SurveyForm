<h1> SurveyForm</h1>

**<p>In this project, I created a coffee evaluation (survey) form using html form elements and css. In the project, a warning box will not appear if the email and name are not entered, html elements such as checkbox and radio buttons were used and styled with css. At the same time, the site design was made suitable for mobile and tablet devices.</p>**
